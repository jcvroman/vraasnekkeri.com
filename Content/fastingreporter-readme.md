## ❤️ Health App Help
### 🔐 Health App Access
#### 🗒️ Does FastingReporter have access to read Carbohydrates in the Health app?
1. During your initial launch of FastingReporter, was the Health Access screen displayed?
2. Did you allow FastingReporter to read Carbohydrates?
3. If you did not allow FastingReporter to read Carbohydrates, you'll need to go to Settings / Health / Data Access & Devices / FastingReporter, and toggle on allow FastingReporter to read Carbohydrates. FastingReporter cannot report on your data entered in the Health app without this access.
