# Initial launch, has the Health Access screen been displayed

## TIP: For your initial launch of FastingReporter, has the Health Access screen been displayed yet?
### Health Access
#### Initial Launch

For your initial launch of FastingReporter, has the Health Access screen been displayed yet?

Did you allow FastingReporter to read Carbohydrates?

If yes, you can tap Dismiss to start using FastingReporter.

If no, wait here for the Health Access screen (and continue reading). It can sometimes be a bit slow to display.

Once the Health Access screen displays, please allow FastingReporter to read Carbohydrates. (Once Allow has been tapped, it can also sometimes be a bit slow completing and closing.)

You can tap Dismiss to start using FastingReporter.

#### NOTE: If you did not allow FastingReporter to read Carbohydrates, you'll need to go to Settings / Health / Data Access & Devices / FastingReporter, and toggle on allow FastingReporter to read Carbohydrates. FastingReporter cannot report on your data entered in the Health app without this access.
