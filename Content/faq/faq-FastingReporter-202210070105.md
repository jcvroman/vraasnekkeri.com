# Health Access screen never displayed

## ISSUE: Health Access screen never displayed through multiple launches of the app.

For your initial launch of FastingReporter, if the Health Access screen was not displayed, and it did not display for a second launch of the app, you may have run into a rare issue where sometimes older devices do not display it. Sometimes an error is displayed. Sometimes it fails silently. It leaves the Health Access permissions for FastingReporter in an incomplete state.

Please contact us if you run into this issue. We have only seen it in development environments.

### SOLUTION:
1. Delete FastingReporter.
2. Install FastingReporter.
3. Restart your device.
4. Launch FastingReporter.
5. Continue with the initial launch...
6. Wait for the Health Access screen to display

#### NOTE: Occasionally, on some older devices it can take 30 to 60 seconds for the Health Access screen to display.
