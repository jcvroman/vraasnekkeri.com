# Health Access screen slow to display so you quit app

## ISSUE: Health Access screen slow to display so you quit the app.

For your initial launch of FastingReporter, the Health Access screen was slow to display, so you quit the app before it came up.

**NOTE:** Occasionally, on some older devices it can take 30 to 60 seconds for the Health Access screen to come up.

### SOLUTION:
Launch FastingReporter again, and the Health Access screen should display shortly.
