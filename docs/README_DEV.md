## Version Control System (VCS)
A version control system (VCS) tracks the history of changes as people and teams collaborate on projects together. As developers make changes to the project, any earlier version of the project can be recovered at any time.

### VCS Standards
#### [Conventional Commits Spec](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)
The Conventional Commits specification is a lightweight convention on top of commit messages. It provides an easy set of rules for creating an explicit commit history; which makes it easier to write automated tools on top of. This convention dovetails with SemVer, by describing the features, fixes, and breaking changes made in commit messages.
